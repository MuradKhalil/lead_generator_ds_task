# lead_generator_ds_task

This is a repository with my attempt to build a lead generation model. My exploratory steps can be found in the notebook and html file inside the notebooks folder.

I also (shamelessly) decided to build an API for my poor performing model. The app can be started by running `$ ./api.sh` in terminal and then accesing `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. A csv file can be uploaded there to make predictions on.

The model can also be retrained by running `./train.sh`
